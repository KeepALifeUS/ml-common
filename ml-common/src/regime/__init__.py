Market Regime Classification Module
Context7 Enterprise Patterns for Adaptive Trading

This module provides lightweight regime classification for the 768-dimensional state vector.
Enables autonomous AI to adapt trading strategies based on market conditions.

Key Features:
- Volatility regime classification (4 dims)
- Trend regime classification (4 dims)
- Time-based features (2 dims)
- <2ms latency for real-time trading
- Interpretable regime labels (for explainability)

Architecture:
- volatility.py: Low/Medium/High/Extreme volatility detection
- trend.py: Strong Up/Weak Up/Sideways/Weak Down/Strong Down classification
- market_hours.py: Trading session, day-of-week encoding

Use Cases:
- Circuit breakers (halt trading in extreme volatility)
- Position sizing (reduce size in high volatility)
- Strategy selection (momentum in trending, mean-reversion in ranging)
- Risk management (tighter stops in volatile regimes)

Usage:
    from ml_common.regime import classify_volatility_regime, classify_trend_regime

    # Historical prices (168h window)
    prices = [50000, 50100, 50200, ...]

    # Volatility regime (4 dims)
    vol_features = extract_volatility_features(prices, window=24)
    # Returns: [regime_id, volatility_percentile, regime_duration, regime_stability]

    # Trend regime (4 dims)
    trend_features = extract_trend_features(prices, window=24)
    # Returns: [trend_id, trend_strength, trend_duration, trend_acceleration]

    # Time features (2 dims)
    time_features = extract_time_features(timestamp)
    # Returns: [session_id, day_of_week_normalized]
